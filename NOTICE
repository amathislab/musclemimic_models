   MyoSim provides the foundational musculoskeletal models (MyoArm, MyoLegs,
   MyoTorso, MyoHand, MyoHead) that MuscleMimic Models builds upon. These
   models were originally converted from OpenSim to MuJoCo format by the
   MyoSuite team.

Asset Provenance Summary
------------------------

All mesh files (STL) distributed in this package are sourced exclusively from
the MyoHub/myo_sim repository (Apache License 2.0). Left-side variants (_l)
were generated by mirroring the corresponding right-side myo_sim meshes on the
Z axis.

  model/meshes/
    Arm & hand bones    -> myo_sim (see 2 above)
      Right-side: directly from myo_sim
      Left-side (_l): Z-axis mirror of myo_sim right-side meshes

    Leg bones           -> myo_sim (see 2 above)
      (pelvis, femur, tibia, fibula, talus, foot, patella — both R and L)

    Torso/spine bones   -> myo_sim (see 2 above)
      (sacrum, lumbar1-5, thoracic1_s-12_s, thorax)

    Head bones          -> myo_sim (see 2 above)
      (hat_cervical, hat_jaw, hat_skull)

================================================================================

Modifications from upstream MyoSuite/myo_sim models:

  - Corrected left-right limb asymmetries in joint definitions and muscle paths
  - Fixed muscle-jumping behaviors at joint limits
  - Combined MyoArm, MyoLegs, MyoTorso, and MyoHead into unified full-body
    (MyoFullBody) and bimanual (BimanualMuscle) configurations
  - Added explicit collision pairs for self-contact (leg-leg, arm-leg, etc.)
  - Refined muscle attachment sites based on cadaver and MRI validation data
  - Generated left-side mirror variants (_l) from myo_sim right-side meshes
